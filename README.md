# TSP-solver

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a famous Computer Science problem - given a starting city and the cost of travel from one city to another (assuming a list of cities is known), the task is to assign the least cost travel plan for a salesman to travel all cities, with the condition of not visiting a city again.

Traditional 'AI' search algortihms that use heuristic functions can be used to propose a solution to a given map. This is an implementation of the A* algorithm using the Minimum Spanning Tree (of the remaining map) as the heuristic.

Note: This was an assignment completed as part of the Artifical Intelligence course at the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur, India.

[This is a first implementation. A more efficient one might be added later]
